18.435J Quantum Computation
I completed all the assignments from the MIT OpenCourseWare course 18.435J Quantum Computation (Fall 2003) ( https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-435j-quantum-computation-fall-2003/pages/syllabus/.). These assignments covered various topics in quantum computation, and they helped deepen my understanding of the subject.

Additionally, I implemented quantum circuits for the Quantum Fourier Transform and the Amplitude Damping Channel using the Qiskit package in Python. I demonstrated these circuits on IBMâ€™s real quantum computer, gaining hands-on experience with quantum algorithms and noise models. After performing measurements, I conducted quantum state tomography to reconstruct the physical information in the form of a density matrix.
